The shebang is a directive to the loader to use the program which is specified after the #!
as the interpreter for the file in question when you try to execute it. So, if you try to run a
file called foo.sh which has #!/bin/bash at the top, the actual command that runs is /bin/bash foo.sh.
This is a flexible way of using different interpreters for different programs. This is something implemented at 
the system level and the user level API is the shebang convention.

It's also worth knowing that the shebang is a magic number - a human readable one that identifies the file 
as a script for the given interpreter.
